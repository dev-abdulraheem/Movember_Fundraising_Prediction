PROJECT OVERVIEW
    Movember is buildings a future where men live happier, healthier, longer
    lives. On average, men die 6 years earlier than women for largely preventable
    reasons. Rates of prostate cancer and testicular cancer are rising. Movember
    exists to stop men from dying too young. Movember is the leading charity
    tackling mental health and suicide prevention, prostate cancer, and testicular
    cancer on a global scale. In this project, I did the Exploration Data
    Analysis(EDA), Data Transformation, Features Engineering, and Model building
    to make predictions.
